# Pixenby
hey! this is pixenby, at least for now. name is a work in progress. making a pixel-aesthetic full unicode font, idea is to do it on my own. ive found it relaxing to do before, but keep losing track of progress.
the -unstable version contains all characters i've designed, while -stable contains only fully completed codeblocks. at least thats the idea sometimes things dont quite work out that way. 

 its free to use, for personal and non-commercial use, just pls dont be a dick with it. For commercial projects, please contact for permission.
